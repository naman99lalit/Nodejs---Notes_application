# Nodejs---Notes_application

## This is my first project in Nodejs that is used to :

 1.Add data in the file
 
 2.Remove data from the file
 
 3.Read particular data from the file
 
 4.Show the data present in the file
 
 
 ## This application is very easy to use: 
 
 1.You need to first open command prompt and then check whether you have node installed in it or not.
 
 2.Then just go to the specific folder and run the command "node app2.js".
 
 3.The project will open up and you can start using it .
